          <h2>What we collect</h2>
          <p>The profile details you choose to enter (such as age, weight, conditions and medicines), prescriptions you upload, and the results of tools you run. We use Google sign-in only to create your secure account.</p>
          <h2>How it's protected</h2>
          <p>Your data is stored in our secure cloud database with row-level security, meaning each record is locked to your own account. Prescriptions are kept in a private, per-user storage area. No other user can access your information.</p>
          <h2>How it's used</h2>
          <p>Your profile is used solely to personalize the AI tools you run. We do not sell your data or share it with advertisers.</p>
          <h2>Your control</h2>
          <p>You can update your profile at any time from your dashboard. To delete your account and data, contact us.</p>
